Princess Nyna, we have mere moments before[NL]
the millennial palace falls to the enemy.[A][NL]
We must escape from here at once.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
But, what about my father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][NL]
I cannot just leave him.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, this is His Majesty's order.[A][NL]
If you manage to escape, we will be able[NL]
to restore Archanea at a later date[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
So please, Princess.[NL]
For Archanea's future[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if it's my father's orders,[NL]
I refuse to escape alone.[A][NL]
I shall remain in the palace, together[NL]
with my father until the very end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess Nyna...[A][NL]
Please consider His Majesty's feelings.[A][NL]
We are fighting against time, now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No.[A][NL]
No matter what you may persuade,[NL]
I shall remain here.[A]

Bishop Boah! Princess Nyna![NL]
There you are![A][NL]
The enemy is fast approaching.[NL]

It cannot be helped.[A][NL]
Dolph, Macellan.[NL]
Take Princess Nyna away from here.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, sir.[A]
