During the War of Shadows...[A][NL]
The royal palace of Archanea, the[NL]
largest kingdom on the continent,[A][NL]
was in a truly hopeless situation,[A][NL]
under the merciless onslaught of[NL]
the Dolhrian army led by[A][NL]
the Shadow Dragon Medeus.[A][NL]
As the footsteps of the imperial[NL]
soldiers started resounding[A][NL]
through the palace walls...[A][NL]
King Archanea, with no other[NL]
alternatives to consider, gave[A][NL]
a secret order to the bishop Boah.[A][X]
