Munchin' Manaketes![A][NL]
Am I surprised to face you[NL]
directly in the battlefield,[A][NL]
Princess Minerva.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Ruben.[A][NL]
I didn't think I'd find you[NL] 
here, not after you were[A][NL]
banished from the army[NL]
for your acts of brutality[A][NL]
against civilians.[A][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]So you lead the deserters.[A][NL]
Surrender.[A][NL]
If you don't, I shall strike[NL]
you down as an enemy of Macedon![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRuben]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I don't take orders[NL]
from you anymore.[A][NL]
For some reason, the folks[NL]
at Macedon worship you[A][NL]
royals as if you were gods.[A][NL]
Yet, the crown prince[NL]
fancies himself a patricide,[A][NL]
the older sister is a charmless[NL] buffoon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
and the younger sister is[NL]
a brat whose only talent[A][NL]
is getting kidnapped.[A][NL]
Who on earth could put[NL]
up with the stupid military,[A][NL]
when even the country's[NL]
like that too?[A][NL]
Wouldn't you agree,[NL]
Minerva the Buffoon![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]
Dastard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
How dare you belittle us![A][NL]
I believe you've just[NL]
shown your readiness[A][NL]
to accept your fate.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadRuben]
Heh![A][NL]
Not if I kill[NL]
you first![A][X]
