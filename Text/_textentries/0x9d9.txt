[OpenMidLeft][LoadLena][OpenMidRight][LoadRickard]
Here, this is a rough sketch of the palace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh my gosh, Rickard.[NL]
How did you come by this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? Oh, er, I got this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
From a traveler.[NL]
Yeah, a traveler.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
Rickard, show me your tongue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeeeeeeek![A][NL]
No, no, I remembered wrong.[NL]
Err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I found it lyin' around as[NL]
I passed by a nearby room,[A][NL]
so I, er, borrowed it for a bit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Rickard![A][2NL]
Taking things without permission[NL]
is a terrible thing to do.[A][NL]
No wonder people mistake you for a bandit.[A][2NL]
I'll go apologize for you later,[NL]
so don't do it again. Am I clear?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yeah, I won't do it again.[A][NL]
Promise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
Rickard, tell us the plan already.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? Oh yeah, sure. Lessee[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
First, there's a rampart HERE.[NL]
We'll cross it and open the door.[A][NL]
Then, once we're HERE,[NL]
Navarre will take the lead.[A][NL]
Meanwhile, Castor and[NL]
I will stay close behind.[A][NL]
We'll take care of any guys[NL]
who escape from you, Navarre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Though I hardly think there's[NL]
anyone who'd survive my blade[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeek! No, no, gotta focus.[A][NL]
Either way, I'll show 'em my moves[NL]
as soon as we encounter the treasure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't forget I'll be watching.[A][NL]
Always.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
C-c'mon, Navarre![A][NL]
Whadya think I'm gonna do?[NL]
Run off with all the treasure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, exactly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Even though I'm workin' sooo[NL]
hard to save people in need[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
My own comrades[NL]
don't even trust me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Oh, woe is me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Sniff, sniff, waaah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Oh, Rickard![NL]
Don't cry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
Navarre, you went too far this time.[A][2NL]
Rickard is but a fragile child[NL]
whose feelings are easily hurt[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uwaaaah! Lenaaaaa![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's okay, Rickard.[A][NL]
I believe in you.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadCastor]
Hmmmmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
So that's how you get[NL]
people to trust you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Very clever[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rickard, get off the cleric.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeeep! Alright, I got it.[NL]
Then uh, back to the plan![A][2NL]
Lena, you stay behind us, alright?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
I'm coming along too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, if you don't, who's gonna heal[NL]
us when we get all battered an' bruised?[A][NL] 
Besides, Navarre here said he wouldn't[NL]
come with us unless you were comin'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
I don't remember saying that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
You don't need to say anythin'![NL]
I can tell these things![A][NL]
Navarre, you're the type that has a soft[NL]
spot for a pretty face and the right features.[A][NL]
C'mon, you can't fool me.[A][NL]
I can see in your eyes aaaall[NL]
the troubles you've had with women.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
You sure like spouting nonsense.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh?[NL]
Castor, whatcha you doing?[A][NL]
have you been taking[NL]
notes of our conversation?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCastor]
What? Oh no, this is, err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Reference.[NL]
Yes, it's for reference.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell me,[NL]
you're planning a con act,[A][NL]
with Rickard as the base.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadRickard]
No way![A][2NL]
I'm so cute and cheerful that[NL]
everybody forgives me if I just smile![A][2NL]
But don't think copyin' my style would[NL]
suit a serious guy like you, Castor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Excuse me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Why is everyone talking about[NL]
conning and thievery again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ahaha. 'Tis nothing, my dear Lena.[A][NL]
Anyways I'm gonna catch some shut-eye.[A][NL]
Good night y'all![A]
[ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How irresponsible.[A][NL]
Sister, I'm going to rest as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Alright. Good night, Navarre.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadCastor]
It seems even Navarre, the Scarlet Swordsman,[NL]
completely fell for Rickard's smooth talk.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you really think so?[A][NL]
To me, it just seems like[NL]
he's bullying poor Rickard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Haha, you're too good of a person.[A][NL]
Anyway, I'll rest for a bit, too.[NL]
How about you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'll stay here a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
But, don't blame yourself too much.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is saving people really so difficult[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Am I just a step away[NL]
from committing a sin?[A][NL]
Oh, gods![NL]
Please protect our weak souls[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]
