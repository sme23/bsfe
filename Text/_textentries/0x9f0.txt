General Camus![A][NL]
We have recieved news that General[NL]
Bulzark of Dolhr is coming here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][NL]
It seems Emperor Medeus[NL]
has risen from his slumber.[A][2NL]
It's not as if I didn't see this coming[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
what should I do[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]NL]
Someone, bring the[NL]
princess to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNyna]
General Camus, has[NL]
something happened?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess Nyna,[A][NL]
Medeus's personal guards should arrive[NL]
here, at the palace, at any moment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The Dolhrian army!?[A][NL]
For what purpose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
To take you back to Dolhr, naturally.[A][2NL]
As a hostage to keep Archanea[NL]
permanently under their leash.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No! I refuse![NL]
I will not go to Dolhr![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I know.[NL]
We must escape[NL]
the palace at once.[A][2NL]
Sir Hardin, in the[NL]
northern state of Aurelis,[A][NL] 
has the power to protect you.[A][2NL]
I'm sure he will extend[NL]
you his courtesy.[A][2NL]
Anyway, let us be off.[NL]
We haven't a moment to spare.[A][NL]
Princess, get ready.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[A][NL]
But, Camus.[A][NL]
You have no qualms with this?[A][NL]
Will you not be in danger,[NL]
should we escape?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh.[A][NL]
It's too late
to waver[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I've known this was coming[NL]
for me, for a long time already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then, you have made your decision?[A][2NL]
Camus, if you're going to abandon[NL]
your country, then I[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nyna, you're mistaken.[A][2NL]
I don't fear Dolhr or Medeus,[A][NL]
but the Kingdom of Grust[NL]
means everything to me.[A][NL]
I cannot betray it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL][......]
Why are you[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][......][A][2NL]
If you help me, you'll be a criminal.[A][NL]
And yet, you say you'll remain in Grust?[NL]
They'll kill you![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I remember telling you, Princess.[A][NL]
That you could have[NL]
my life anytime.[A][NL]
Well, that time has come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
I refuse![A][NL]
I don't want to be saved if[NL]
you are sacrificed in exchange![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Haha, you're still a child, Nyna.[A][2NL]
It reminds me of when we[NL]
first met, two years ago.[A][NL]
If I recall correctly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
You said you would command the[NL]
Archanean League's army to topple Dolhr.[A][NL]
And for that purpose, you have[NL]
worked very hard in these two years.[A][NL]
The people call you the[NL]
white rose of Archanea.[A][NL]
Neat and trim on the outside;[.....][NL]
you hide such passion and enthusiasm.[A][NL]
You give courage to all who[NL]
come in contact with you.[A][NL]
Opportunities appear as we create them.[A][NL]
And should one present itself,[A][NL] 
the people will surely[NL]
unite and oppose Dolhr, no?[A][NL]
Or do you intend to ruin[NL]
everything you've worked for?[A][NL]
All for a fleeting fancy?[A][NL]
Nyna, were you always this weak?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][....][A][NL]
Very well.[NL]
I shall do as you say.[A][NL]
However, let me make this clear:[A][NL]
my love for you means[NL]
everything to me![A][NL]
It isn't some "fleeting fancy".[A][NL]
You've always been[NL]
on my mind[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
True, I said I hated you once.[A][NL]
But it was a lie;[NL]
I was just fooling myself[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It was love at first sight![A][NL]
I'm not strong at all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
I need you by my side[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
It was because you were here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
that I had anything to live for[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....]Princess.[A][NL]
That's enough, I get it [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadBelf][OpenMidRight]
Belf, take care of the princess.[A]
Give orders to the court ladies[NL]
and hurry the preparations.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes sir. Understood.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadNyna][OpenMidRight]
Come, Princess.[A][NL]
We must prepare.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......]Very well.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadReiden]
General Camus![A][NL]
We, the Sable Knights,[NL]
shall accompany you![A][NL]
With the Sable Order with you,[NL]
no force of Dolhr can withstand you.[A][NL]
Please, give us your orders![A]
[OpenMidRight]
That will not do.[A][NL]
Should we sortie[NL]
an official army,[A][NL]
the alliance between Grust[NL]
and Dolhr will crumble.[A][NL]
The hostages-[......][NL]
Princes Yubello included-[A][NL]
will be killed.[A][NL]
And Medeus would no[NL]
doubt burn Grust to ashes.[A][NL]
I cannot allow that to happen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadRoberto]
Then, at least take[NL]
us three with you.[A][NL]
We'll desert the army.[A][NL]
That way, we won't bring[NL]
trouble to our motherland, Grust.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
Thank you.[A][NL]
I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
to get you all involved.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you joking with us?[A][NL]
Either way, the[NL]
princess is ready.[A][NL]
It's time to take[NL]
our leave, General.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Excellent, then let us march![A][NL]
Make sure the others[NL]
suspect nothing.[A][X]
