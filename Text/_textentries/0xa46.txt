Camus, I can see why[NL]
Grust loves you so.[A][NL]
You've annihilated an[NL]
entire batallion by yourself.[A][NL]
I didn't imagine that[NL]
it would come to this.[A][NL]
Truly, your power is[NL]
beyond imagination.[A][NL]
However, this farce ends here.[A][NL]
Your sword is broken[NL]
and your spear lost.[A][NL]
Even you cannot fight bare-handed.[A]

We have him now.[A][NL]
Put him in a cage,[NL]
and drag it behind the carriage.[A][NL]
He'll prove a fine example of the[NL]
fate that awaits those who oppose Dolhr.[A][NL]
Strip him![A][NL]
Give him only enough food to keep him alive.[A][NL]
Everyone shall lauch at the misery[NL]
of their once great hero,[....] Camus![A][NL]
Bwahahahahaha![A][NL]
