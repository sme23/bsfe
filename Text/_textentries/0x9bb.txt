[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
W-what the hell is wrong with you!?[NL]
Stay outta our way if you value yer life![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your vile deeds[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
cannot be overlooked.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
T-these guys[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Damn you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] We'll remember this![A]
[ClearFace][LoadMinerva]
Sir, what is your name?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I have no name worthy of note.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Bah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see.[A][2NL]
Well, fair enough.[NL]
The actions of those men offended me, too,[A][NL]
but I see you were faster to the hunt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
By any chance, are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Dame Minerva of Macedon?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed I am.[NL]
But how did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I heard the Macedoniam army had a[NL]
beautiful woman, clad in scarlet armor.[A][2NL]
Rumors say she's a gifted soldier,[NL]
nicknamed the Crimson Dragoon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Those rumors are grossly exaggerated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Either way, I presume those men[NL]
weren't official Macedonian soldiers?[A][NL]
Are they deserters?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
As much as it shames me,[NL]
that seems to be the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A][2NL]
Then, I believe I have a[NL]
firm grasp of the situation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Where do you intend to go, now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am heading towards[NL]
the fortress near here.[A][2NL]
According to the villagers,[NL]
the scoundrels we saw before[A][NL]
are using it as their base and[NL]
ravaging the nearby villages.[A][2NL]
Apparently the kidnapped village[NL]
maidens were taken there as well.[A][2NL]
There isn't a moment to waste.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What in heavens!?[NL]
There's a large group of them?[A][2NL]
I don't believe it[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][NL]
That can't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, if you'll excuse me,[NL]
I must hurry ahead![A][2NL]
Wolf, Roshea, let's go.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, wait![.....][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPalla]
Commander, what are our orders?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Palla[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I'll follow them, together[NL]
with Catria and Est.[A][2NL]
You are to go ahead to the[NL]
castle and bring reinforcements.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, understood.[NL]
The castle isn't far from here.[A][2NL]
I shall return as soon as I can,[NL]
so please don't push yourselves.[A][2NL]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadCatria][OpenMidLeft]
Catria, Est.[NL]
Take care of the commander.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sister.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadEst]
Leave it to us![A]
[ClearFace][LoadMinerva][OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCatria][OpenMidRight]
Catria, Est, let's[NL]
follow them at once.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood![A][X]
