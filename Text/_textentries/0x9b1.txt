If it has come to this, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x6][0x1]
Princess, what are you doing!?[NL]
Please stay your hand![A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Bishop, don't stop me![A][NL]
Now that Midia has failed,[NL]
I have no desire to live[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x9][0x1]
You're Princess Nyna, I assume?[A][2NL]
Not only your knight, but you as well[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
are all Archaneans this irresponsible?[A][2NL]
In Grust, this kind of behavior is[NL]
reserved for spoilt children only.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Insolent cur![A][NL]
On what grounds are you [NL]
calling me irresponsible?[A][NL]
And what do you mean by spoilt!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are a member of royalty.[A][2NL]
Now that your king has passed away, you[NL]
must shoulder responsibility of Archanea.[A][2NL]
Wishing to throw away your life[NL]
without considering the consequences[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Please spare me of this selfishness.[A][2NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Dying is easy.[A][NL]
However, what would become of[NL]
the people you would leave behind?[A][2NL]
Do you truly intend to throw away[NL]
your responsibility as royalty?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
How dare you try and lecture me![NL]
Y-you drove my father to his death[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me for what I am about to say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But your father was a failure of a king.[A][2NL]
He drowned in pleasure, neglected politics,[NL]
and ultimately abandoned his people.[A][NL]
Archanea's miserable defeat was his doing.[A][2NL]
The one who led your people to despair[NL]
was none other than the king himself.[A][2NL]
It is the king's duty to protect his people.[A][NL]
King Archanea may have been[NL]
a good father to you,[A][NL]
but he was an incompetent[NL]
king to his people.[A][2NL]
My words may be harsh,[NL]
but I only speak the truth.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel pity for my people.[A][NL]
I warned my father time and time again,[NL]
but he never listened.[A][2NL]
However, Archanea has already fallen.[A][NL]
What do you suggest I[NL]
do at this point!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
At the very least, Emperor Medeus currently[NL]
does not wish to kill you, Princess.[A][2NL]
So, you continue to live on, to your fullest,[NL]
and bring hope to the citizens of Archanea[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I hear your citizens love you.[NL]
To them, you embody the hope of Archanea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ohh[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, this unfortunate war is now over.[A][2NL]
I must now return to Grust,[NL]
but, in a few months,[A][NL]
I shall return as the commander[NL]
of the occupation army.[A][2NL]
I am no politician, but watching this[NL]
desolate land brings pain to my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I wish for the kingdom of Archanea to become[NL]
the verdant land it once was,[A][NL]
as soon as possible.[A][2NL]
Princess Nyna, may I ask[NL]
for your assistance?[A][NL]
Would you deign to rebuild Archanea,[NL]
together with your people?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][NL]
I shall give you the benefit of the doubt.[A][2NL]
However, don't think my hatred[NL]
towards you has disappeared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you wish to take my life,[NL]
you can have it anytime.[A][NL]
If that's what it takes to satisfy you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No. I shall endure for now,[NL]
for my motherland, Archanea.[A][2NL]
However, I shall lead the Archanean[NL]
League's army and fight Dolhr.[A][2NL]
Should you stand in my way when that[NL]
time comes, I shall display no mercy.[A][NL]
Remember that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[A][2NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Princess.[A][NL]
I thought your people adored you[NL]
because of your beauty,[A][NL]
but it seems there's more[NL]
to it than that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You speak rather impolitely,[NL]
but I'll accept your praise graciously.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahaha, please excuse my rashness.[A][2NL]
As but a soldier from the borderlands,[A][NL]
I can only manage this rustic[NL]
manner of speaking.[A][NL]
So, please forgive me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it is fine.[A][NL]
I, too, must become stronger.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Bishop, Midia, everyone,[NL]
please heed me.[A][NL]
I have made my choice.[A][2NL]
No matter how thorny that path might be,[NL]
one day, assuredly,[A][NL]
I shall take back our motherland[NL]
Archanea from the empire.[A][2NL]
I know it'll be difficult for[NL]
everyone, but for now, please endure.[A][NL]
So that, one day, we may[NL]
reunite in this very palace![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x6][0x1]
