[OpenMidRight][LoadRickard][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier]
Get them! There they are! This way![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uwah! L-let go of me![NL]
Nooo, stooooooop![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Oh[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
L-Lena![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCamus][OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Who-who are you!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am Camus of Grust.[NL]
I am the one in charge of this palace.[A][NL]
Are you the thieves who intruded here?[A][2NL]
Hmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
and a cleric too?[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadLena][OpenMidLeft]
Sister, what is the meaning of this?[A][NL]
Why are you aiding these pack of thieves?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
So you are General Camus.[A][NL]
Indeed, we came here to steal treasure.[A][2NL]
However, we're only doing this[NL]
for the people of Archanea.[A][NL]
Don't you know[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL] 
how much suffering the Dolhrian army is causing[NL]
to the people of this sacred land of Archanea[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Ever since the Dolhrian army invaded,[NL]
Archanea has changed for the worst.[A][NL]
Many have had their houses razed, lands stolen,[NL] 
and are now suffering from hunger even.[A][NL]
General Camus![A][NL]
Do you take joy in seeing[NL]
everyone so miserable?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Sister, 'tis true that Archanea's[NL]
misery brings pain to my heart.[A][NL]
However, I am a soldier.[A][NL]
So long as my motherland[NL]
Grust obeys Dolhr,[A][NL]
I, too, must follow[NL]
the empire's orders.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
General![A][NL]
Then, are you nothing[NL]
but Dolhr's pawn?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I suppose[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
regrettably, that's the only[NL]
way one could describe me.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadNyna]
Please wait![A][NL]
General Camus, you[NL]
are no pawn of Dolhr.[A][NL]
Think about it![NL]
You defied Emperor Medeus's orders,[A][NL]
allowing me to keep my honor[NL]
and freedom as a princess.[A][NL]
I am certain that, deep inside,[NL]
you despise Dolhr as much as we do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps you're right.[A][NL]
However, just what do you expect I do[ToggleMouthMove]...!?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
You could turn a blind eye once[NL]
again and let these people walk free.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena][OpenMidRight]
Sister, I'll let you keep[NL]
the treasure you've obtained.[A][NL]
Please distribute it[NL]
among the poor and needy.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Princess Nyna?[A][NL]
Oh, thank you so much![A][2NL]
With this gold, we'll finally be[NL] 
able to begin rescuing the poor.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Camus, I beg of you.[A][NL]
Take these people[NL]
to somewhere safe.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCamus]
Haha, if it's an order[NL]
from you, Princess,[A][NL]
then what choice do I have?[A][X]
