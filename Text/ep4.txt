##ch4scrolltext
Two years have passed since[NL]
the millenial palace[A][NL]
was seized by Grust's Camus the Sable.[A][NL]
Emperor Medeus of Dolhr ordered[NL]
Camus to take full control of the palace.[A][NL]
However Camus defied his orders,[NL]
by continuing to shelter Princess Nyna.[A][NL]
As time passed,[A][NL]
Medeus lost his patience with Camus[NL]
and ordered his men to take Nyna captive.[A][X]


##ch4opening1
[OpenMidRight][LoadBulzark][OpenMidLeft][LoadMedeus]
Do you understand, Bulzark?[A][NL]
I must have Nyna without fail.[NL]
Capture her and bring her to me, alive.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Please leave it to me, my lord.[A][NL]
However, what are my orders,[NL]
should General Camus betray us?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If he resists, you may kill him.[A][NL]
I care not for him any longer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
As you wish[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##ch4opening2
[OpenMidRight][LoadCamus][OpenMidLeft][LoadSoldier]
General Camus![A][NL]
We have recieved news that General[NL]
Bulzark of Dolhr is coming here.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I see.[A][NL]
It seems Emperor Medeus[NL]
has risen from his slumber.[A][2NL]
It's not as if I didn't see this coming[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
what should I do[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Someone, bring the[NL]
princess to me![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNyna]
General Camus, has[NL]
something happened?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess Nyna,[A][NL]
Medeus's personal guards should arrive[NL]
here, at the palace, at any moment.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]The Dolhrian army!?[A][NL]
For what purpose?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
To take you back to Dolhr, naturally.[A][2NL]
As a hostage to keep Archanea[NL]
permanently under their leash.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No! I refuse![NL]
I will not go to Dolhr![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I know.[NL]
We must escape[NL]
the palace at once.[A][2NL]
Sir Hardin, in the[NL]
northern state of Aurelis,[A][NL]
has the power to protect you.[A][2NL]
I'm sure he will extend[NL]
you his courtesy.[A][2NL]
Anyway, let us be off.[NL]
We haven't a moment to spare.[A][NL]
Princess, get ready.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Fine.[A][NL]
But, Camus.[A][NL]
You have no qualms with this?[A][NL]
Will you not be in danger,[NL]
should we escape?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh.[A][NL]
It's too late[NL]
to waver[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I've known this was coming[NL]
for me, for a long time already.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then, you have made your decision?[A][2NL]
Camus, if you're going to abandon[NL]
your country, then I[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Nyna, you're mistaken.[A][2NL]
I don't fear Dolhr or Medeus,[A][NL]
but the Kingdom of Grust[NL]
means everything to me.[A][NL]
I cannot betray it.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
But, then[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL][......]
Why are you[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][......][A][2NL]
If you help me, you'll be a criminal.[A][NL]
And yet, you say you'll remain in Grust?[NL]
They'll kill you![A]
[OpenMidRight]
I remember telling you, Princess.[A][NL]
That you could have[NL]
my life anytime.[A][NL]
Well, that time has come.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
I refuse![A][NL]
I don't want to be saved if[NL]
you are sacrificed in exchange![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Haha, you're still a child, Nyna.[A][2NL]
It reminds me of when we[NL]
first met, two years ago.[A][NL]
If I recall correctly[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
You said you would command the[NL]
Archanean League's army to topple Dolhr.[A][NL]
And for that purpose, you have[NL]
worked very hard in these two years.[A][NL]
The people call you the[NL]
white rose of Archanea.[A][NL]
Neat and trim on the outside;[.....][NL]
you hide such passion and enthusiasm.[A][NL]
You give courage to all who[NL]
come in contact with you.[A][NL]
Opportunities appear as we create them.[A][NL]
And should one present itself,[A][NL]
the people will surely[NL]
unite and oppose Dolhr, no?[A][NL]
Or do you intend to ruin[NL]
everything you've worked for?[A][NL]
All for a fleeting fancy?[A][NL]
Nyna, were you always this weak?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][....][A][NL]
Very well.[NL]
I shall do as you say.[A][NL]
However, let me make this clear:[A][NL]
my love for you means[NL]
everything to me![A][NL]
It isn't some "fleeting fancy".[A][NL]
You've always been[NL]
on my mind[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
True, I said I hated you once.[A][NL]
But it was a lie;[NL]
I was just fooling myself[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
It was love at first sight![A][NL]
I'm not strong at all[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
I need you by my side[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
It was because you were here[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][NL]
that I had anything to live for[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....]Princess.[A][NL]
That's enough, I get it [ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadBelf][OpenMidRight]
Belf, take care of the princess.[A]
Give orders to the court ladies[NL]
and hurry the preparations.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes sir. Understood.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadNyna][OpenMidRight]
Come, Princess.[A][NL]
We must prepare.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......]Very well.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadReiden]
General Camus![A][NL]
We, the Sable Knights,[NL]
shall accompany you![A][NL]
With the Sable Order with you,[NL]
no force of Dolhr can withstand you.[A][NL]
Please, give us your orders![A]
[OpenMidRight]
That will not do.[A][NL]
Should we sortie[NL]
an official army,[A][NL]
the alliance between Grust[NL]
and Dolhr will crumble.[A][NL]
The hostages-[......][NL]
Princess Yubello included-[A][NL]
will be killed.[A][NL]
And Medeus would no[NL]
doubt burn Grust to ashes.[A][NL]
I cannot allow that to happen![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadRoberto]
Then, at least take[NL]
us three with you.[A][NL]
We'll desert the army.[A][NL]
That way, we won't bring[NL]
trouble to our motherland, Grust.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......]I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
Thank you.[A][NL]
I'm sorry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][......][NL]
to get you all involved.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Are you joking with us?[A][NL]
Either way, the[NL]
princess is ready.[A][NL]
It's time to take[NL]
our leave, General.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Excellent, then let us march![A][NL]
Make sure the others[NL]
suspect nothing.[A][X]

##ch4opening3
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBulzark][OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier]
Lord Bulzark![A][NL]
Princess Nyna has[NL]
fled the palace.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What did you say!?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
She left together[NL]
with General Camus.[A][NL]
Moreover, a few[NL]
knights are with them.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Damn that Camus.[NL]
He really has betrayed us.[A][NL]
So, where are they headed?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
They are headed straight north.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Aurelis, huh?
Very well.[A][NL]
Tell the entire army to march north![A][NL]
Strike them down as[NL]
soon as you catch up.[A][NL]
We must bring Nyna back[NL]
before she takes refuge in Aurelis.[A][X]

##ch4opening4
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBulzark]
Camus of Grust, you filthy traitor![A][NL]
I won't let you escape![A][NL]
Surrender while you still can![A][X]

##ch4opening5
[OpenMidRight][LoadNyna][OpenMidLeft][LoadCamus]
Blast[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
We're almost in Aurelis,[A][NL]
yet they've already[NL]
caught up to us?[A][NL]
Nyna, we'll hold[NL]
them back here.[A][NL]
Go ahead to Aurelis![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Please.[A][NL]
If I must flee,[NL]
then it will be by your side.[A][NL]
I want to be with you,[NL]
at least until we reach Aurelis.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Nyna[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadReiden][OpenMidLeft]
Reiden, Belf, Roberto![A][NL]
We'll pass through the mountains,[NL]
while we protect the princess.[A][NL]
I understand there are many[NL]
bandits in this region[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Kill any bandits in our way,[NL]
but do not pursue those who flee.[A][NL]
Our objective is to make sure the[NL]
princess safely reaches Hardin of Aurelis.[A][NL]
Understood?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A]
[ClearFace][LoadNyna][OpenMidLeft]
Nyna, we'll pass this valley and[NL]
run towards the northeast fortress.[A][NL]
That's the border of Aurelis.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Don't worry, we'll protect you.[A][NL]
Now, let us make haste![A][X]

##ch4villagetext
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][CurrentPortrait][OpenMidLeft][LoadGirl]
You're being pursued[NL]
by Dolhr, aren't ya?[A][NL]
Please take this.[A][NL]
I'm sure it'll assist[NL]
you in your escape.[A][NL]
I, too, am a citizen of Archanea[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][.....][A][NL]
and as such, an ally to your cause.[A][NL]
No, go![....][NL]
You can't stay here any longer[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##ch4turn1end1
[OpenMidLeft][LoadBulzark]
You! Don't lower your guard.[A][NL]
Our enemies may be few in number,[A][NL]
but they're the elite[NL]
of Grust's Sable Order.[A][NL]
Moreover, Camus the Sable is equipped[NL]
with the legendary spear, Gradivus.[A][NL]
I will march forward as[NL]
soon as my unit is ready,[A][NL]
but you lot march on[NL]
ahead and pursue the enemy![A][NL]
If things go well,[NL]
you might be able to capture Nyna,[A][NL]
who's slower for being on foot.[A][X]

##ch4turn1end2

Hey, hey, hey![NL]

##ch4talknynacamus
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCamus][OpenMidRight][LoadNyna]

[OpenMidLeft]
You need not worry about me.[A][NL]
Nyna, you cannot stay here forever.[NL]
We'll hold the enemy back.[A][NL]
Please, worry not for me.[NL]
Just hurry ahead already![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Camus[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's alright, Nyna.[A][NL]
I'm not dying any time soon![A][X]

##ch4turn3end
[OpenMidRight][LoadSoldier][OpenMidLeft][LoadBulzark]
Hey! Have we captured them yet?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
It'd be a hard battle, sir.[A][NL]
The soldiers are afraid because[NL]
Camus is monstrously strong;[A][NL]
he's like a demon on the warpath.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Then I'll take him on myself![A][NL]
Order the entire army to attack![A][NL]
Send a message to the bandits![A][NL]
Tell them there's a reward in gold for[NL]
whoever captures Camus and his motley crew![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A][X]

No matter how many enemies we kill,[NL]
there seems to be no end to them.[A][NL]
Are reinforcements coming from the rear[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
There's nothing to do about it.[NL]
But I still have the Gradivus![A][NL]
As long as I have this spear,[NL]
I will not fall back![A][X]
