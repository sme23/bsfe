During the War of Shadows...[A][NL]
The royal palace of Archanea, the[NL]
largest kingdom on the continent,[A][NL]
was in a truly hopeless situation,[A][NL]
under the merciless onslaught of[NL]
the Dolhrian army led by[A][NL]
the Shadow Dragon Medeus.[A][NL]
As the footsteps of the imperial[NL]
soldiers started resounding[A][NL]
through the palace walls...[A][NL]
King Archanea, with no other[NL]
alternatives to consider, gave[A][NL]
a secret order to the bishop Boah.[A][X]

##BS1b
[SetName]Boah[NL]
Princess Nyna, we have mere[NL]
moments[A] before the millennial[NL]
palace falls to the enemy.[A][NL]
We must escape[NL]
from here at once.[A][X]

##BS1b2
[SetName]Nyna[NL]
But, what about my father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]?[A][NL]
I cannot just leave him.[A][X]


##BS1b3
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x6][0x1]
Princess, this is His Majesty's order.[A][NL]
If you manage to escape, we will be able[NL]
to restore Archanea at a later date[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
So please, Princess.[NL]
For Archanea's future[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Even if it's my father's orders,[NL]
I refuse to escape alone.[A][NL]
I shall remain in the palace, together[NL]
with my father until the very end.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess Nyna...[A][NL]
Please consider His Majesty's feelings.[A][NL]
We are fighting against time, now.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No.[A][NL]
No matter what you may persuade,[NL]
I shall remain here.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x08][0x01]
Bishop Boah! Princess Nyna![NL]
There you are![A][NL]
The enemy is fast approaching.[NL]
Please make your escape, quickly![A][NL]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x2][0x01]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see...[NL]
It cannot be helped.[A][NL]
Dolph, Macellan.[NL]
Take Princess Nyna away from here.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x07][0x01]
Yes, sir.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, Boah![NL]
Father! Father[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x6][0x01]
...Forgive me, Princess.[A][2NL]
Now, everyone, hurry![A][X]

##BS1c
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x30][0x01]
Hwahahaha![A][NL]
So that's where you were hidin',[NL]
ghosts of the Archanean army.[A][NL]
Why don't you jus' give up?[A][NL]
I'll spare you your sorry[NL]
lives if you submit to us.[A][X]

##BS1d
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x6][0x01]
Oh dear...[NL]
So this is it...?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x2][0x01]
Bishop Boah, where are we?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
In a chamber inside the palace.[A][NL]
I'm sad to say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] we're completely[NL]
surrounded by imperial soldiers...[A][NL]
It seems it was poor[NL]
judgement on my part.[A][2NL]
Princess, I brought you here[NL]
in such a rude fashion[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
What I did was truly unforgivable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Not at all.[NL]
I was behaving like a spoiled child.[A][NL]
I am the one who should apologize.[A][2NL]
Either way, bishop,[NL]
what is our recourse now?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Unfortunately, at this point[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
We have no choice but to surrender.[A][2NL]
I shall negotiate with the enemy so[NL]
they won't lay their hands on you.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
Bishop Boah![A][NL]
Are you telling us to[NL]
surrender without a fight?[A][2NL]
I refuse![A][NL]
I will not accept the possiblity of[NL]
surrendering to the likes of them![A]
[OpenMidRight]
Midia, don't be selfish.[A][NL]
Do you intend to involve[NL]
Princess Nyna in this battle?[A][2NL]
The princess is the last hope[NL]
of the people of Archanea.[A][2NL]
What would you tell them,[NL]
should anything befall her?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I[ToggleMouthMove]..[ToggleMouthMove] I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Forgive my rashness.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x2][0x01]
Bishop.[NL]
I agree with Midia.[A][2NL]
No matter what grim fate awaits us,[A][NL]
I want us to hold our heads high[NL]
with pride until the very end.[A][2NL]
If Midia and the others[NL]
say they'll fight for me,[A][NL]
then I want to entrust[NL]
them with my final desire.[A][2NL]
Bishop, please allow[NL]
my wish to become true.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
If you're ready to go that far,[NL]
then there is nothing I can say.[A][2NL]
Everything shall be as you wish[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
May our guardian deity Naga protect us.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Thank you, Bishop Boah.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
[OpenMidLeft]
Midia, please do what you must.[A][2NL]
I'll burn the image of your[NL]
valorous figure in my mind.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ClearFace][LoadFace][0x08][0x01]

Please assist Midia.[A][NL]
I shall never forget any of you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, m'lady![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x04][0x01]
Alright, let's go![A][NL]
Let's show those imperial soldiers[NL]
that Archanea still has true knights![A][2NL]
First, we should all move towards[NL]
that small treasure room nearby.[A][2NL]
If Dolph, Macellan and[NL]
myself guard the entrance,[A][NL]
the interior will be safe.[NL]
Let's hurry there![A][X]

## BS1end1

Princess Nyna is 'ere![A][NL]
We need reinforcements! Bring the[NL]

Alright, that's quite enough.[NL]
Both sides, lower your weapons.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x6B][0x1]
You're[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]General Camus![A][NL]
Why are you 'ere[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I hear that the princess of Archanea[NL]
is in this room, is this true?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A][2NL]
They are but few in number, yet,[NL]
some knights are 'ere with 'em.[A][2NL]
They gave us some trouble, but the[NL]
princess' capture was inevitable.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see. Good job.[A][2NL]
But you've done enough, you[NL]
may leave the rest to me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, sir![A]
[ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft]
Listen well, Archanea.[A][2NL]
I am Camus, captain of[NL]
the Grustian knights.[A][2NL]
I respect your prowess in battle, but further[NL]
bloodshed is of no value to you or I.[A][NL]
May I request that you lower your weapons?[A][2NL]
I wish to speak with you.[NL]
I have no weapons on my person.[A][2NL]
I swear upon the honor of Grust[NL]
that I will not deceive you.[A]

Camus of Grust[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
The one they call Camus the Sable.[A][2NL]
He brought about the downfall of Archanea,[NL]
and is responsible for the deaths of many[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
Bishop[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
He is a hated enemy![NL]
I shall never forgive him![A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
Princess, leave it to me.[A][NL]
I shall kill Camus.[NL]
He killed my parents.[A][2NL]
Nothing would make me happier than to[NL]
do battle with him, as my final stand.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x6][0x1]
Wait, Midia, don't be hasty.[A][2NL]
Do you know what tragedy would befall[NL]
the princess should you do that?[A][2NL]
Camus may be our enemy, but I hear he[NL]
is a proud, exceptionally strong knight.[A][2NL]
He may even be able to[NL]
protect the princess[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadFace][0x2][0x1]
Bishop![A][2NL]
I do not wish to be protected,[NL]

[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
...[ToggleMouthMove]A woman?[A][2NL]
It happened so sudden,[NL]
I couldn't hold back.[A][NL]
My apologies.[A][2NL]
However, I see Archanea's paladins[NL]
are fond of dishonorable tactics.[A][NL]
To think they would ambush an unarmed foe.[A][2NL]
Not only is the Archanean army[NL]
thoroughly disappointing,[A][NL]
but even the knights have no pride?[NL]
No wonder your kingdom had fallen.[A]
[OpenMidRight][LoadFace][0x4][0x1]
Damn you! You're one to talk![A][2NL]
I would not resort to such means[NL]
if my opponent were anyone but you![A][2NL]
Pride you say[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove] Surely you jest![A][2NL]
Your country betrayed Archanea and[NL]
degraded itself as Dolhr's slave![A][2NL]
What are you!?[A][NL]
The captain of Dolhr's dogs, that's what![A][2NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Enough of this. Kill me![NL]
You don't need to hold back![A]

## BS1end5c

[OpenMidLeft][LoadFace][0x9][0x1]
In Grust, this kind of behavior is[NL]
reserved for spoilt children only.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Insolent cur![A][NL]
On what grounds are you [NL]
calling me irresponsible?[A][NL]
And what do you mean by spoilt!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You are a member of royalty.[A][2NL]
Now that your king has passed away, you[NL]
must shoulder responsibility of Archanea.[A][2NL]
Wishing to throw away your life[NL]
without considering the consequences[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Please spare me of this selfishness.[A][2NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Dying is easy.[A][NL]
However, what would become of[NL]
the people you would leave behind?[A][2NL]
Do you truly intend to throw away[NL]
your responsibility as royalty?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
How dare you try and lecture me![NL]
Y-you drove my father to his death[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Forgive me for what I am about to say[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
But your father was a failure of a king.[A][2NL]
He drowned in pleasure, neglected politics,[NL]
and ultimately abandoned his people.[A][NL]
Archanea's miserable defeat was his doing.[A][2NL]
The one who led your people to despair[NL]
was none other than the king himself.[A][2NL]
It is the king's duty to protect his people.[A][NL]
King Archanea may have been[NL]
a good father to you,[A][NL]
but he was an incompetent[NL]
king to his people.[A][2NL]
My words may be harsh,[NL]
but I only speak the truth.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I feel pity for my people.[A][NL]
I warned my father time and time again,[NL]
but he never listened.[A][2NL]
However, Archanea has already fallen.[A][NL]
What do you suggest I[NL]
do at this point!?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
At the very least, Emperor Medeus currently[NL]
does not wish to kill you, Princess.[A][2NL]
So, you continue to live on, to your fullest,[NL]
and bring hope to the citizens of Archanea[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I hear your citizens love you.[NL]
To them, you embody the hope of Archanea.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ohh[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess, this unfortunate war is now over.[A][2NL]
I must now return to Grust,[NL]
but, in a few months,[A][NL]
I shall return as the commander[NL]
of the occupation army.[A][2NL]
I am no politician, but watching this[NL]
desolate land brings pain to my heart[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I wish for the kingdom of Archanea to become[NL]
the verdant land it once was,[A][NL]
as soon as possible.[A][2NL]
Princess Nyna, may I ask[NL]
for your assistance?[A][NL]
Would you deign to rebuild Archanea,[NL]
together with your people?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][NL]
I shall give you the benefit of the doubt.[A][2NL]
However, don't think my hatred[NL]
towards you has disappeared.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
If you wish to take my life,[NL]
you can have it anytime.[A][NL]
If that's what it takes to satisfy you.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No. I shall endure for now,[NL]
for my motherland, Archanea.[A][2NL]
However, I shall lead the Archanean[NL]
League's army and fight Dolhr.[A][2NL]
Should you stand in my way when that[NL]
time comes, I shall display no mercy.[A][NL]
Remember that.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood.[A][2NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Princess.[A][NL]
I thought your people adored you[NL]
because of your beauty,[A][NL]
but it seems there's more[NL]
to it than that.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]You speak rather impolitely,[NL]
but I'll accept your praise graciously.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Hahaha, please excuse my rashness.[A][2NL]
As but a soldier from the borderlands,[A][NL]
I can only manage this rustic[NL]
manner of speaking.[A][NL]
So, please forgive me.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No, it is fine.[A][NL]
I, too, must become stronger.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Bishop, Midia, everyone,[NL]
please heed me.[A][NL]
I have made my choice.[A][2NL]
No matter how thorny that path might be,[NL]
one day, assuredly,[A][NL]
I shall take back our motherland[NL]
Archanea from the empire.[A][2NL]
I know it'll be difficult for[NL]
everyone, but for now, please endure.[A][NL]
So that, one day, we may[NL]
reunite in this very palace![A]
