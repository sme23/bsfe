Oh, Navarre! Please wait a moment.[A][NL]
[OpenMidRight][LoadNavarre]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ah, err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

so we've been looking for somebody[NL]
capable to be our bodyguard.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]I'm expensive.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]

Oh no, I mean[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
How expensive?[A][NL]
I don't have much gold on hand[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
However, we need more help if we are[NL]
to save the people in the village[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]

You're not gonna live long if[NL]

What happened to ya?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I desperately needed gold for me[NL]
mother and young siblings back home.[A][2NL]
When I heard there'd be people[NL]
willin' to hire me in this city,[A][2NL]
I came here without[NL]
thinkin' to eat or drink[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Hmm, I gotcha.[A][2NL]
Oh, in that case,[NL]

We'll have gold if[NL]

Then, let me come along![A]
[ClearFace][LoadLena]

[OpenMidRight]
Eh? Lena![NL]

He rescued me from[NL]
a tricky situation.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Woah, he's mighty scary![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena][OpenMidRight][NL]
Oh right, Lena.[A][NL]

[ClearFace][LoadCastor]
I am Castor, a hunter.[A][NL]
Rickard saved me life.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadRickard]
Saved your life?[A][NL]
C'mon, you're exaggeratin'![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Teehee.[A][2NL]
Rickard, it seems I[NL]
have misunderstood you.[A][2NL]
I was unaware of how thieves operate,[NL]
so I thought they were all bad people.[A][2NL]
But you're different, aren't you?[A][2NL]
You desperately seek gold,[NL]
but only so you can save people.[A][NL]
Am I right?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
W-well, sorta![A][NL]
Y-yeah, it's somethin' like that.[A][NL]
Hahaha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ClearFace][LoadCastor]
I-I need gold for me ill mother[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
You guys[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

Or I'll slice your tongues off.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadRickard]
Ah-ahahahaha[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]

##ch3opening4
[SetName]Rickard [NL]
Here, this is a rough sketch[NL]
of the palace.[A][X]

##ch3opening4point5
[OpenMidLeft][LoadLena][OpenMidRight][LoadRickard]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh my gosh, Rickard.[NL]
How did you come by this?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? Oh, er, I got this[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
From a traveler.[NL]
Yeah, a traveler.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
Rickard, show me your tongue.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeeeeeeek![A][NL]
No, no, I remembered wrong.[NL]
Err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I found it lyin' around as[NL]
I passed by a nearby room,[A][NL]
so I, er, borrowed it for a bit.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Rickard![A][2NL]
Taking things without permission[NL]
is a terrible thing to do.[A][NL]
No wonder people mistake you for a bandit.[A][2NL]
I'll go apologize for you later,[NL]
so don't do it again. Am I clear?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yeah, I won't do it again.[A][NL]
Promise.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
Rickard, tell us the plan already.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh? Oh yeah, sure. Lessee[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
First, there's a rampart HERE.[NL]
We'll cross it and open the door.[A][NL]
Then, once we're HERE,[NL]
Navarre will take the lead.[A][NL]
Meanwhile, Castor and[NL]
I will stay close behind.[A][NL]
We'll take care of any guys[NL]
who escape from you, Navarre.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Though I hardly think there's[NL]
anyone who'd survive my blade[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeek! No, no, gotta focus.[A][NL]
Either way, I'll show 'em my moves[NL]
as soon as we encounter the treasure.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't forget I'll be watching.[A][NL]
Always.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
C-c'mon, Navarre![A][NL]
Whadya think I'm gonna do?[NL]
Run off with all the treasure?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, exactly.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Sigh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Even though I'm workin' sooo[NL]
hard to save people in need[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
My own comrades[NL]
don't even trust me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Oh, woe is me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Sniff, sniff, waaah![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Oh, Rickard![NL]
Don't cry[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
Navarre, you went too far this time.[A][2NL]
Rickard is but a fragile child[NL]
whose feelings are easily hurt[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Uwaaaah! Lenaaaaa![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
It's okay, Rickard.[A][NL]
I believe in you.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadCastor]
Hmmmmmm[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
So that's how you get[NL]
people to trust you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Very clever[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Rickard, get off the cleric.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Eeeep! Alright, I got it.[NL]
Then uh, back to the plan![A][2NL]
Lena, you stay behind us, alright?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
I'm coming along too?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Well, if you don't, who's gonna heal[NL]
us when we get all battered an' bruised?[A][NL]
Besides, Navarre here said he wouldn't[NL]
come with us unless you were comin'.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
I don't remember saying that[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
You don't need to say anythin'![NL]
I can tell these things![A][NL]
Navarre, you're the type[NL]
that has a soft spot[A][NL]
for a pretty face and[NL]
the right features.[A][NL]
C'mon, you can't fool me.[A][NL]
I can see in your eyes aaaall[NL]
the troubles you've had with women.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
You[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
You sure like spouting nonsense.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Huh?[NL]
Castor, whatcha you doing?[A][NL]
have you been taking[NL]
notes of our conversation?[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadCastor]
What? Oh no, this is, err[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Reference.[NL]
Yes, it's for reference.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Don't tell me,[NL]
you're planning a con act,[A][NL]
with Rickard as the base.[A]
[ClearFace][LoadRickard]
No way![A][2NL]
I'm so cute and cheerful that[NL]
everybody forgives me if I just smile![A][2NL]
But don't think copyin' my style would[NL]
suit a serious guy like you, Castor![A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena]
Excuse me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Why is everyone talking about[NL]
conning and thievery again?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Ahaha. 'Tis nothing, my dear Lena.[A][NL]
Anyways I'm gonna catch some shut-eye.[A][NL]
Good night y'all![A]
[ClearFace][LoadNavarre]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]How irresponsible.[A][NL]
Sister, I'm going to rest as well.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Alright. Good night, Navarre.[A]
[OpenMidRight][ClearFace][LoadCastor]
It seems even Navarre,[NL]
the Scarlet Swordsman,[A][NL]
completely fell for Rickard's smooth talk.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Do you really think so?[A][NL]
To me, it just seems like[NL]
he's bullying poor Rickard[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
Haha, you're too good of a person.[A][NL]
Anyway, I'll rest for a bit, too.[NL]
How about you?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I'll stay here a little longer.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
But, don't blame yourself too much.[A]
[ClearFace][OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Is saving people really so difficult[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
Am I just a step away[NL]
from committing a sin?[A][NL]

So you are General Camus.[A][NL]
Indeed, we came here[NL]
to steal treasure.[A][NL]
However, we're only doing this[NL]
for the people of Archanea.[A][NL]
Don't you know...[A][NL]
how much suffering the[NL]

to the people of this[NL]

So long as my motherland[NL]

Please wait![A][NL]
General Camus, you[NL]
are no pawn of Dolhr.[A][NL]
Think about it![NL]
You defied Emperor Medeus's orders,[A][NL]
allowing me to keep my honor[NL]
and freedom as a princess.[A][NL]
I am certain that, deep inside,[NL]
you despise Dolhr as much as we do[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Perhaps you're right.[A][NL]
However, just what do you expect I do[ToggleMouthMove]...!?[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
[OpenMidRight]
You could turn a blind eye once again[NL]
and let these people walk free.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadLena][OpenMidRight]

the treasure you've obtained.[A][NL]
Please distribute it[NL]
among the poor and needy.[A]

Even though his country[NL]

he wasn't particularly fond[NL]

a small sign of resistance against Dolhr...?[A][NL]
