Aurelis: a nation situated in the[NL]
north-eastern plains of the continent.[A][NL]
A verdant kingdom, sharing the[NL]
deepest bonds with the Holy Kingdom[A][NL]
of Archanea since its foundation.[A][NL]
However, as a result of the[NL]
aggressive attack of the Macedonian[A][NL]
dracoknights led by Princess Minerva,[A][NL]
Aurelis had already ceded most of[NL]
its territory to the Dolhrian empire.[A][NL]
As Princess Minerva returned to her[NL]
post in Aurelis with her subordinates,[A][NL]
a certain village caught her eye...[A][X]

No! Get away from me[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A]

Heh heh heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Jus' come o'er 'ere already.[A]

[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva][OpenMidLeft][LoadMan]
Aiyee! The Macedonian[NL]
army is here as well?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Wait, what's going on here?[NL]
What are those men doing?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Ehh?[NL]
You ain't on their side?[A][2NL]
In that case, I beg o' you![NL]
Please drive those foul demons away.[A][2NL]
They kidnap women, loot everythin',[NL]
and act like this town's theirs[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
We just can't keep livin' like this.[NL]
So, please, you have to help us![A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
To think the Macedonian army[NL]
houses such shameless scoundrels[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I demand an explanation.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPalla]
I've heard rumors that deserters from our[NL]
army are in cahoots with the local bandits[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
And they've been committing atrocities[NL]
using the Macedonian army's name[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCatria]
I wonder if those men are[NL]
the ones you're describing?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Either way, we cannot just let them be.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][LoadEst]
Oh, Commander![NL]
Please look over there![A][X]

W-what the hell is wrong with you!?[NL]
Stay outta our way if you value yer life![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your vile deeds[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
cannot be overlooked.[A]

Sir, what is your name?[A][X]

##ch2opening3point7
[SetName]Hardin[NL]
I have no name worthy of note.[A][X]

##ch2opening3point9
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHardin]
[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]
Bah[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] I see.[A][2NL]
Well, fair enough.[NL]
The actions of those men offended me, too,[A][NL]
but I see you were faster to the hunt.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
By any chance, are you[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Dame Minerva of Macedon?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Indeed I am.[NL]
But how did you know?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I heard the Macedoniam army had a[NL]
beautiful woman, clad in scarlet armor.[A][2NL]
Rumors say she's a gifted soldier,[NL]
nicknamed the Crimson Dragoon.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
Those rumors are grossly exaggerated.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Either way, I presume those men[NL]
weren't official Macedonian soldiers?[A][NL]
Are they deserters?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
As much as it shames me,[NL]
that seems to be the case.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I see.[A][2NL]
Then, I believe I have a[NL]
firm grasp of the situation.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Where do you intend to go, now?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
I am heading towards[NL]
the fortress near here.[A][2NL]
According to the villagers,[NL]
the scoundrels we saw before[A][NL]
are using it as their base and[NL]
ravaging the nearby villages.[A][2NL]
Apparently the kidnapped village[NL]
maidens were taken there as well.[A][2NL]
There isn't a moment to waste.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
What in heavens!?[NL]
There's a large group of them?[A][2NL]
I don't believe it[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][NL]
That can't be[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
So, if you'll excuse me,[NL]
I must hurry ahead![A][2NL]
Wolf, Roshea, let's go.[A][ClearFace]
[OpenMidRight]
Ah, wait![.....][NL]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]They're gone.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadPalla]
Commander, what are our orders?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Palla[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I'll follow them, together[NL]
with Catria and Est.[A][2NL]
You are to go ahead to the[NL]
castle and bring reinforcements.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Yes, understood.[A][X]

##ch2opening99
[SetName]Palla [NL]
The castle isn't far from here.[A][NL]
I shall return as soon as I can,[NL]
so please don't push yourselves.[A][NL]
Catria, Est.[NL]
Take care of the commander.[A][X]

##ch2opening990

##ch2opening991

Leave it to us![A][X]

##ch2opening992

Father Frost.[NL]
Have you made your decision?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
No matter how many times you[NL]
ask, my answer is the same.[A][NL]
I will not betray Macedon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidLeft]
What? You still spouting that[NL]
rubbish? That's fine by me.[A][2NL]
If you can't obey my orders, then[NL]
I'll have your head on a plate.[A][2NL]
And not only your head, but the heads[NL]
of your family and relatives as well.[A][NL]
That's a lot of plates I'll be needing.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
D-damn[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
Just what[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][NL]
am I supposed to do[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

##ch2opening5
[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]
Catria, Est.[NL]
There are archers nearby.[A][2NL]
Beware their attacks or[NL]
it could cost you dearly.[A]
[OpenMidLeft][LoadHardin]
Dame Minerva, leave[NL]
the archers to us.[A][2NL]
We shall make[NL]
mincemeat of them.[A][NL]
You fly on ahead.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Very well.[NL]
I'll leave that in your hands.[A][NL]
[OpenMidLeft][ClearFace][OpenMidRight]
Then, let's go.[A][X]

##ch2talkhardinminerva
[OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva][OpenMidLeft][LoadHardin]
Dame Minerva, are you unhurt?[A]
[OpenMidRight]
Yes, you needn't worry[NL]
about my well-being.[A][NL]
What about you, sir?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
No issues here, either.[A][2NL]
However, the enemies are many,[NL]
so we mustn't lower our guards.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
To think so many shameless[NL]
scoundrels would claim to be[A][NL]
part of the noble[NL]
Macedonian army[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
The misdeeds of Macedon[NL]
are my responsibility.[A][NL]
Do not interfere.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
With all due respect, Dame Minerva,[NL]
a battle cannot be won alone.[A][2NL]
As we share the same[NL]
contempt towards the enemy,[A][NL]
it would benefit both of us[NL]
to join forces against them.[A]
[OpenMidRight]
[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove]Very well.[A][NL]
However, don't overlook yourself.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Your worry is superfluous.[NL]
I am at home, here.[A][2NL]
Well, let us go![A][X]

##ch2talkcatriaminerva
[OpenMidLeft][LoadCatria][OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]
Catria![NL]
The enemy general is mine.[A][2NL]
I shall leave the[NL]
other soldiers to you.[A][2NL]
However, don't[NL]
underestimate them.[A][2NL]
Be sure to finish each[NL]
of them in one blow.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Understood, Commander.[A][X]

##ch2talkestminerva
[OpenMidLeft][LoadEst][OpenMidRight][LoadMinerva]

This battlefield is wide,[A][NL]
but don't go too far[NL]
ahead by yourself.[A][2NL]
And keep and eye out[NL]
for enemies as you proceed.[A]

Yes ma'am![NL]
I'll do my best![A][X]

Why are you aiding those[NL]
vile excuses for people?[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Princess Minerva[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove] Forgive me[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
The truth is, Ruben threatened me.[NL]
If I didn't do what he wanted,[A][NL]
he said he would do away[NL]
with my family and I[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A]
[OpenMidRight]
I see[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
Father Frost, you may rest at ease.[NL]
We shall destroy the bandits.[A][2NL]
We won't let them lay a single[NL]
finger on you or your family.[A][NL]
I swear upon my honor.[A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Oh, Princess Minerva[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I'm glad I could count on you.[A][NL]

You're the people from before[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
I beg of you.[A][NL]
Please, please save our village.[A][2NL]
We can't do[NL]
anything to help[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
But at least, take this vulnerary.[A][NL]
Please take care[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][X]

Lord Ruben, it's an enemy attack![A][NL]
An unknown force led by a[NL]
dracoknight is headin' this way![A]
[OpenMidLeft]
Did you say a dracoknight?[A][2NL]
Who would want to come to[NL] 
a backwater place like this[ToggleMouthMove]...?[ToggleMouthMove][A][2NL]
But they don't seem that dangerous.[NL]
Don't worry about them.[A][2NL]
Should they approach this fortress,[NL]

Heh[ToggleMouthMove]...![ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
I don't take orders[NL]
from you anymore.[A][NL]
For some reason, the folks[NL]

Yet, the crown prince[NL]
fancies himself a patricide,[A][NL]
the older sister is a charmless[NL] buffoon[ToggleMouthMove]...[ToggleMouthMove][A][NL]
and the younger sister is[NL]
a brat whose only talent[A][NL]
