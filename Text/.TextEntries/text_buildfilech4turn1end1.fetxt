[OpenMidLeft][LoadBulzark]

You! Don't lower your guard.[A][NL]

Our enemies may be few in number,[A][NL]

but they're the elite[NL]

of Grust's Sable Order.[A][NL]

Moreover, Camus the Sable is equipped[NL]

with the legendary spear, Gradivus.[A][NL]

I will march forward as[NL]

soon as my unit is ready,[A][NL]

but you lot march on[NL]

ahead and pursue the enemy![A][NL]

If things go well,[NL]

you might be able to capture Nyna,[A][NL]

who's slower for being on foot.[A][X]
